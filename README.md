Game Board
The game board will consist of four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. The buttons will be arranged in a circular pattern. In addition, there will be a count display that will show the current level of the game and a start button to start the game.

Game Logic
The game will start with a random color and sound sequence that will be played by the game. The player will have to follow the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. If the player clicks the buttons in the wrong order, the game will end. If the player successfully completes the sequence, the game will advance to the next level with an additional color and sound added to the sequence.

Functionality
The game will have the following functionality:

Start Button: Clicking the start button will start the game.
Color and Sound Sequence: The game will generate a random color and sound sequence for each level.
Player Input: The player will input their guess by clicking the buttons in the same order as the sequence presented by the game.
Win Condition: The game will end when the player reaches level 20.
Score Keeping: The game will keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen.
Conclusion
In this project, we will build a Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will create a game board consisting of colored buttons arranged in a circular pattern, a count display, and a start button. The game logic will generate a random color and sound sequence for each level, and the player will have to follow the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. We will also include functionality such as score keeping, win conditions, and player input.
